This is really handy for certain kinds of games like platformers or top-down racing games (though there are LOTS of other kinds of games that benefit from this) where the view is the &#39;camera&#39; and its position is set once per frame.</p><p>When you don&#39;t require scrolling, and when your cart boots, <code>SCY</code>/<code>SCX</code> is typically set to 0,0. When a screen is displayed, it appears normally even though you only set the values once.

Well, we need to change that value <em>before</em> line 0 starts, which means it has to be done in the VBlank. And <strong>that</strong> means we need one more element.

This is because they were moved into HRAM. (Also notice that they don&#39;t have to be next to each other in memory.) They were moved to HRAM for a couple of reasons: it allows an optimization in the swapping code (11 cycles vs 28), and it makes the use code slightly faster. There are only 2 bytes used now so that is a better candidate for moving to HRAM than 4 bytes.</p><h3 id="vblank" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vblank" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VBlank</h3><p>In this system, code in the VBlank is responsible for two things:</p><ul><li>swapping the pointers</li><li>setting the data for line 0</li></ul><p>We&#39;ve already seen what swapping the pointers looks like, but how is the data set for line 0?

There are 3 states to this effect:</p><ul><li>The image is stable and a progression line moves up the screen starting each line on its way</li><li>The table cycles a few times</li><li>The image stability is restored with the progression line moving up the screen</li></ul><p>The values in the table can dramatically change the effect. For example, if the sine cycle was short enough, you could simulate a smoke effect (for example). Try it out!</p><p>Also, you could create a &#39;glitch&#39; effect during a cut-scene, perhaps in a sci-fi game to simulate a slightly dirty transmission.</p><p><img src="`+h+'" alt="X Sine"></p><h3 id="y-vertical-sine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#y-vertical-sine" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Y (Vertical) Sine</h3><p>This effect is structured very similar to X Sine, in that there is a table of sine values driven by 3 states.

This would move just like water!</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="XY Sine"></p><h3 id="smear-on" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#smear-on" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Smear On</h3><p>This is like a flood fill effect used as an appearance transition. It&#39;s quite simple in that it repeats the lines to achieve the &#39;smear&#39; effect and is perhaps more interesting than a fade in.</p><p>The specific image used in the tutorial is light along the bottom so it looks better if the screen was already light before the effect starts. You would change this to suit your image.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="Smear On"></p><h3 id="smear-off" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#smear-off" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Smear Off</h3><p>This is a disappearance transition and the reverse of Smear On. Due to the specific image that was used (i.e. it is light along the bottom), it looks better in this tutorial to have the effect reveal a light screen instead of dark. Again, you would change this to suit your image.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="Smear Off"></p><h3 id="roll-on" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#roll-on" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Roll On</h3><p>This effect simulates an image unrolling onto the screen. This might be useful for fantasy RPGs to transition to a map screen or perhaps a message written on a scroll. The image unrolls over a dark screen because the top of the image is mostly dark so it looks better to keep it dark than the contrast of using a light screen.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="Roll On"></p><h3 id="roll-off" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#roll-off" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Roll Off</h3><p>This effect simulates an image rolling off screen. This might be useful for fantasy RPGs to transition away from a map or scroll screen. This reveals a dark screen because the first thing you see in the roll is dark (because that&#39;s what&#39;s in VRAM below the screen). Keeping it dark made the transition more seamless.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="Roll Off"></p>',74),T=e("The roll effects look complicated but the implementation is probably one of the simpler ones.

It&#39;s structured in a logical way and there are comments where applicable.</p><p>The effects are called &quot;parts&quot; by the code and each part has an <code>Init</code> and <code>Process</code> routine. The sequence is controlled by a table of <code>Init</code> pointers and driven by the <code>ProcessPartTransition</code> routine. Each <code>Init</code> is responsible for setting up the data for the effect (part) and to set the <code>Process</code> function pointer via the <code>SetProcessFunc</code> macro. When the effect is done, the <code>Process</code> routine calls the <code>SetChangePartFlag</code> to tell the tutorial driver to move to the next part.</p><p>There are non-effect parts present to get the effect sequence looking good when the parts are played one after the other. These are &quot;delay&quot; parts of various flavors:</p><ul><li><code>ShowDelay</code>: this shows the screen normally for a few seconds</li><li><code>LightDelay</code>: this shows a light-colored blank screen for a few seconds</li><li><code>DarkDelay</code>: this shows a dark-colored blank screen for a few seconds</li></ul><p>The <code>Delay</code> parts share code because they&#39;re only present to make the ROM look nice, but the effects parts were developed in a way to be isolated from one another. This was done to make extraction easier. Because of this, you will see similar code present across several parts, for example, the various Sine effects.</p><p>One quirk you might notice when looking at VRAM is that the tile map is placed at 0,4 instead of 0,0. This was done to get the roll/unroll to handle the top of the screen correctly. The effects look best when they smoothly (dis)appear off-screen and if the image was placed at 0,0, the code to handle that would be distracting to how to implement the core of the effect.</p><p>Another topic worth mentioning is the row of light tiles that are under the image in VRAM. This was necessary to allow <code>LightDelay</code> to exist. Those light tiles don&#39;t <em>have</em> to be right under the image, that&#39;s just where it was placed for this tutorial. It could be moved well out of the way so it doesn&#39;t affect the effects that show that part of VRAM (Y Sine, Roll On, Roll Off).</p>',8),P=e("If you run the ROM in "),q={href:"https://bgb.bircd.org/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},z=e("BGB"),X=e(" and have the Debug Messages window open, you will see the various parts announce themselves when they are initialized."),j=s("h2",{id:"exercises-for-the-reader",tabindex:"-1"},[s("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#exercises-for-the-reader","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Exercises for the reader")],-1),E=e("You can do more things than just change the scroll registers.
